  In the notebook, you will find how I implemented methods that I have learned upon doing the project. For example, using stacking models together or cross_validation to train ML models. However, while learning the aforementioned techniques, I additionally learned how to tackle skewed data, because linear models prefer normal distributed data rather than right/left skewed one. To deal with skewness, we can use the log function, sqrt function, or box cox transformation.

  Upon thinking of which ML models I could choose, I found out about the robustscaller method which makes models more robust to outliers. For instance, I integrated it with Lasso (L1 regularization) and Elastic Net models. Furthermore, I explored the possibilities of finding the best hyperparameters for ML models - such as random forest or gradient boosting. Yet, there are other methods besides GridSearchCV, such as RandomizedSearchCV (it wasnâ€™t applied in this notebook)

Data was used from the Kaggle competition tab [House prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). 

Using above mentioned techniques, I managed to rank at the top 750th currently out of 4400+ participants.
